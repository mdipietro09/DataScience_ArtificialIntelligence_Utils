A proposed European law on software patents will not be re-drafted by the European Commission (EC) despite requests by MEPs.But that will not guarantee that the directive will become law - instead it will probably mean further delays and controversy over the directive.Supporters say current laws are inefficient and it would serve to even up a playing field without bringing EU laws in line with the US.If the European Council agrees on the draft directive it will then return for a second reading at the European Parliament.Most EU legislation now needs the approval of both parliament and the Council of Ministers before it becomes law.Some major tech firms say it is needed to protect inventions, while others fear it will hurt smaller tech firms The EC says the Council of Ministers will adopt a draft version that was agreed upon last May but said it would review "all aspects of the directive".
